## Overview

Object detection is a computer vision technique that enables the identification and localization of objects in images. This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect objects and classify them with high accuracy. The model can be trained on any object detection dataset and customized to identify a variety of objects.

## Features

- Detects multiple objects in an image.
- Configurable to recognize different classes of objects.
- Supports visualization of bounding boxes around detected objects.
- Uses a pre-trained neural network or can be trained from scratch.

## Installation

To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Irshad463/Object-detection.git
cd Object-detection
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the object detection model on a set of images:

1. Place images in the specified directory.
2. Run the detection script.

Example command:

```bash
python detect.py --input path/to/images --output path/to/save/results
```

## Model Training

If you want to train the model on a custom dataset:

1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. Modify the configuration file with dataset paths and model parameters.
3. Run the training script.

Example command:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

## Results
